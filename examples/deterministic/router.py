"""A toy support-ticket router: the system under test for the offline example.

Four versions of the same function, chosen to exercise every branch of the gate:

* ``baseline_route``   — the current production rules.
* ``regressed_route``  — someone "tidied" the billing keywords. A real regression.
* ``noisy_route``      — adds one keyword; two tickets get worse. Beyond the drop
                         threshold, but two cases out of sixty is not evidence.
* ``refactored_route`` — the same rules restructured. Behaviour is identical.
